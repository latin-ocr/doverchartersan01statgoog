4 August 1285

Enwnao, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of
lreland, Duke of Aquitaine‚ to lus beloved servant in
Christ, the Abbot of Faversharn-Greeting. We have learnt
by the complains of our Barons of Faversham that you,
according to a certain composition formerly made between
you and them, ought to find one man, on your behalf, for
the custody of our prison there at your eost, together with
a certain other man to be found for the same purpose by the
Barons aforesaid: You unjustly, to the great damage of
those Barons and contrary to the aforesaid agreement, now
refuso to find any man for that purpose, as you formerly
did: We, considering that for lack of guard of this kind
danger might be likely to aecrue in the future, command you,
as we have several times commanded, firmly enjoining you,
that you cause to be provided the aforesaid man to guard
the prison aforesaid on your behalf, as you ought and have
been accustomed to do according to the aforesaid composi-
tion, and according to the tenor of our maridates aforesaid
frequently directed to you on that behalf: so that we need
not deservedly punish your fault in this matter, or that you
yourselves come before us wherever we may then be in
England within ις days from the feast of Saint Michael
to reply to the aforenamed Barons why you be not bound to
provide one man for the custody of the prison aforesaid, and
to us why you have disdained to obey our mandates so
frequently directed to you on that behalf, and that you
have there this writ.

Witness myself, at Wolvemere, the fourth day of August
in the thirteenth year of our reign.
