that the chief civic officer was a Doyen “elected by the
inhabitants of the vill, or by the more worthy of
them, to whom belonged the right of making ad-
jornamenta and taking bail.” This view would account
for the teste of Simon the Dean in the Charter in
question, but having submitted it to some whose verdict

told that it is “fanciful ” and “ untenable,” 1 can do no
more than record it as my humble contribution to the
solution of a difficult question. Two facts are patent-

of Dover, and of the other Cinque Porta, that the end
of the Angevin dynasty roughly marks the period at
