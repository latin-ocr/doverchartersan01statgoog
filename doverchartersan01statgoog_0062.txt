we have learnt from the complaint of our Barons of F avers-
ham that you and your bailiffs of Faversham grievously
dietrain our Barons for the performance to you of undue
and unaccustomed services, and that you, contrary toa
certain composition formerly entered into between you and
them, frequently vex 3ηά unjustly oppress them to the
grievous 3ηά weighty hurt of these Barons ε We, unwilling
that you should injure these Barons on this behalf, com-
mand you, as we have often commanded, lirmly en'oining
you, that you entirely desist henceforth from ev ing
exactione and undue distraints of this kind on the afbre-
said Barons, 3ηά cause your bailiffe to desist3 observin
the said agreement according to the tenor thereof, as sh
be just, according to the tenor of our other commanda which
on that behalf you have received: and that you cease the
distraint made upon them on the aforesaid plea without
delay, so that a second complaint on that account shall not
again reach us ; or that you yourselves be before us wherever
