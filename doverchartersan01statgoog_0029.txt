xviii PREFACE

and although there is but small hope of adding many
other names to the list, it is doubtful whether any other
town in England can produce a fuller authentic record.

There are three words which occur in different
documenta which seem to require some explanation·-
Skonsessore on page 873 Lovecmfiy on page 1793 and
Utviethis on page 264. Skomerfare occurs in Gower's

out of pirate vessels, or, what is more probable, the
proportion of profit which each masiner obtained as his
share of the plunder. l am inclined to think the latter is
the right local interpretation of the word, for the Warden,
as the Admiral of the Cinque Porta, always claimed at
least a share in the goods of pirates. The patent of
Henry Brook, Eighth Lord Cobham, as Warden of the
