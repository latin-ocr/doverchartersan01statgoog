We have learnt from the complaint of our Beronr of
Favereham that you, for your part, ought, in accordance
with a certain composition formerly made between you and
them, to find one man, at your own cont, to guard our
llllrlffllltll‘llllllllll llllzlllnhllll
the said unone, aid contrary to t’he ageihent afmcraid,
wrongfully refuse to find, as you formerly found, any man
for this purpose. We, considering that for leck of guard of
this kind danger may be likely to accrue to us in the future,
command you, as we have before commanded you, that you
cause the aforesaid manto bc provided to guard the afore·
said prison on your behalf, as you ought, and have been
accustomed, to do according to the aforesaid agreement, and
according to the tenor of the other our mandate formerly
addressed to you in this behalf, so that we need not decer·
vedly punish your fault in this matter3 or that you show

cause before us why you ought not todo so.
witness mysel , at Westminster, the fifth day of May in
the thirteenth year of our reign.
