Eumne, hythe grace of God, etc, to his beloved, etc.
As we have learnt from the complaint of our Barons of
Faversham that you and your bailiffs there are grievously
distraining the said Barons for the performance of services
not due to you, and, contrary to a certain agreement made
between you and them, molest and in many ways wrongfully
harena them to the great expense and burden of the said Barons:
We, not wishing to injure the said Barons in this matter,
command you, aa we have formerly commanded you, to
desist, and cause your bailiffs there to desist, from henceforth
levying distraints of this sort and undue burdens on the
aforesaid Barons against the agreement aforesaid3 and that
tllhlilhfltll ‘tzt‘rhl hffllhhh ‘slth
other our mandate which you have received in that behalf,
so that further complaint on that account may not reach us,
and cause usto aid them in this matter hythe remedy of

further law ς or that you show cause to us why you should
not perform the premises.

Witness myself at Westminster, the fifth day of May

in the thirteenth year of our reign.
