Prepositus and Clerk of Dover representing the Town.
ln addition to these there are twenty-seven other names,
which are those of important townsmen and Castle
officials. lt will at once be seen that there is a striking
omission, no Mayor of Dover appears among the
witnesses, and what, to me, is more remarkable, a
“Simon the Dean” signs before the Constable. The
question naturally arises, Was there a Mayor of Dover

at this period? l here made considerable research to ‘

tion ofa later date, we are driven back to the Domesday
Book, which clearly proves that in the days of the
Confessor the Burgesses of Dover possessed certain
privileges which they held by a service of ships, and
that, moreover, they had a Gilhalh. lt would be an

J. Round's theory that the municipal customs of Dover
