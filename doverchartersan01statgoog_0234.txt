LXV.
19 February 144⁰·

Hanni, by the grace of God, King of England and France,
and Lord of lreland, to all to whom these present letters
shall come—Greeting.

Know ye that, whereas our beloved the Mayor and
Commonalty of the town of Dover have lately made known to
us that as the persons inhabiting the said town are bound and
similarly engaged to repair and maintain the walls of the same
against the rage and cruelty of the sea there, and other burdens
tthtltllltthhtssthtltltglzltdtt‘htltt
or sufficient in any way to do so, because the walls aforesaid,
in defect of their repair and construction, are battered and
prostrate, so that the sea there is like to inundate and
destroy our said town in process of time unless by us it be
speedily relieved -and succoured: and whereas, from the
time when the town of Calais was con uered and acquired
by our noble progenitor Edward, they ol the said town have
until recently, by great expenses and losses and ventures,
which they from time to time have su ported for the pre-
servation and custody of the aforesaid Passage there, used
and enjoyed liber-ties and franchises subsequently had and
held to thern, to wit, that they of Dover, with its Passage,
should cross to, or land at, the said town of Calais, and not
to any otherv place; nor they of Calais, with its Passage, to
any place except Dover, unless they be impededb a eat
or sudden ternpest, or the King's precept, or by a lleigll or
cargo which does not pertain to the Passage; and that they

. os Dover might have the whole freight or oargo and the ¹

profit of our Passage and ships crossing to, and landing at,
the said town of Calais, and in lilce manner they of Calais
from those crossing to Dover, so that neither they of Calais
should take in any way whatsoever any freight or passage of
the Dover ships, nor they of Dover the freight or passage of
the Calais ships unless impeded by any new arrangement
